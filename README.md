# powershell-scripts

A collection of misceallenous scripts I use for simple tasks.

- find_duplicates.ps1: script that recursively searches a folder and prints paths of files that are duplicates. Two files are assumed to be equal if they have the same name and size.

- music_cleanup.ps1: script to cleanup duplicate files from a folder by comparing with a golden folder.
